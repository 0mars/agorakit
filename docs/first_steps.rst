Quick start after installation
==============================


Discover your installation
--------------------------
Open your browser and go to the url of your web server. If using php's built-in web server it will be : http://localhost:8000

Register account
----------------
Register a first user account : it will be you, and you will be super admin, yeah!

Welcome group
-------------
Create one or more groups. A welcome and a test group are often useful.

Introduction text on the homepage
---------------------------------
Set an intro text on the homepage for newcomers : go to the admin page from your user profile dropdown.
Using the editor you can add external images and whatever you want.

Invite people
-------------
Invite people to one or more groups using the invite feature of each group. You can also add people directly if the already registered on your install. This is particularly useful if people have a hard time to confirm their email address and membership (trust me it happens).

Last step : profit !
--------------------
(or in some cases, revolution!)
