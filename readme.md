## Mobilizator

Mobilize crowds efficiently. Allow anyone to create a collaborative group. No admins involved in the process. Manage communication, decision making, membership, files and events.

Facebook for the paranoid inside any of us.

## Installation

Currently, you need to know how to install a laravel application. This is perfectly standard and documented. You need composer up and running.

In short :

- clone this repository
- copy .env.example to .env and put your db credentials there
$ composer install
$ php artisan key:generate
$ php artisan migrate
$ php artisan db:seed (if you want the db filled with fake infos)
$ php artisan serve

The install will be available to localhost:8000

If you don't know how all this works, don't setup a production server around this tool without first digging laravel docs.
