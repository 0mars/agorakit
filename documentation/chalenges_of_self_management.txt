How to cope with spam and bad behaving people in self managed groups ?

Ideas for the system


We already have multiple level in the membership :

* null : people has never been seen in the system
* 1 : people has been invited
* 2 people joined and confirmed
* -1 people don't want any news from us
* -2 people is blacklisted (?) probably for spammers

-> create a new membership level (level 3) for confirmed people. People are confirmed when a few members confirmed they are real.
